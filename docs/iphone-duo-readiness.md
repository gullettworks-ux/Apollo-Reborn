# iPhone Duo readiness

Apollo Reborn is a Theos/Logos tweak injected into stock Apollo (last App Store
build, 2023). Apollo's own layout and device mapper stop at iPhone 14-era
geometry. Apple's iPhone Duo (foldable, expected ~5.4" outer / ~7.6" inner,
iOS 27.1) will exercise size-class changes, dual scenes, horizontal safe
areas, and hinge reserved regions that neither Apollo nor most of this tweak
were written for.

This is a maintainer plan, not a rewrite. Steps 1–5 are implemented
(device identity + live island geometry, floating tabs / Liquid Glass
scene chrome, feed/post size-class layouts, gallery/media hinge
avoidance, then the 27.1 *tweak* SDK pin with a 26.0 CI fallback).
A follow-on **screen-fill** pass (section 6) addresses the Duo sim
letterbox: the *guest* Apollo binary still advertised SDK 19.0 / 26.

## What is already true in the tweak

| Area | Today | Duo risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device identity (`uname` fishhook in `Tweak.xm`) | Apollo's mapper (`sub_1007a3cdc`) only knows models through iPhone 14 Pro Max. The tweak remaps newer IDs so Pixel Pals / `FauxCutOutView` turn on. **Step 1:** unrecognized iPhones default to the 14 Pro (island) identity; only known notch-only models (16e / 17e) stay on the 14 (notch) identity. No more closed whitelist of every 15/16/17/18 ID. | Process-wide identity is still a single string. A Duo that launches on the inner panel cannot be "island" and "notch" at once. Per-window chrome must keep using live geometry. |
| Dynamic Island chrome | Apollo hardcodes 14 Pro positions (`FauxCutOutView` y=11.5, 125×37). **Step 1:** shift from `-[UIScreen _exclusionArea]` on the *window scene's* screen; hide faux cutout / pals / tap overlay when that screen has no pill-shaped cutout. Dropped the `safeAreaInsets.top == 59` proportional fallback (wrong on iPhone Air / iOS 27, #826). | A hinge or vertical reserved bar must not pass the pill sanity check (it should not). Full `ArrangementView` / `reservedRegions` avoidance is step 4. |
| Floating tabs (`ApolloFloatingTabs.xm`) | **Step 2:** overlay is created on `ApolloDevicePreferredWindowScene()` (never `UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds`). It rebinds on `UISceneDidActivate` and relayouts on safe-area / size-class / bounds changes. Dock, tuck, close target, fan-out, and hold-to-preview use `ApolloDeviceChromeInsetsForView` (safe area + hinge-sized layout-margin extra, not the everyday 16pt). | Overlay is still one window / one scene. A hinge that UIKit does not report as safe area or extra margin is covered for **media/PiP** in step 4; floating-tab bubbles still rely on chrome insets only. |
| Liquid Glass (`ApolloLiquidGlass.xm`) | **Step 2:** nav-title left/right limits use the same chrome insets, so a hinge-adjacent strip shrinks the title/capsule. Pixel snapping uses the window scene's scale. iPad floating-tab placement stays idiom-gated (`ApolloIPadTabBarBottom.xm`). | Inner Duo is still an iPhone idiom with Regular width. Do not turn on the iPad tab-bar-to-bottom path. Action-pill internals are local to the bar-button view (UIKit places the item). |
| Gallery / media (`ApolloGalleryViewController.m`, `ApolloGalleryImageViewer.m`, `ApolloPictureInPicture.xm`) | **Step 4:** chrome / footer / PiP clamp use `ApolloDeviceMediaInsetsForView` (safe area + hinge-sized layout-margin extra). C geometry helpers stay; the reserved-rect list is always empty. `UIArrangementViewController` is detected but unused — media is full-bleed, not a primary/secondary pair. | Do **not** call UIKit `reservedRegions` — it SIGSEGVs on Duo even with window+scene during first CA commit (x0=NULL at +0x10). A hinge UIKit never reports as layoutMargins / safe area still cannot be guessed from `_exclusionArea`. |
| Feed / posts | **Architecture reset (V1):** FeedSplit column pinning is off. Open Duo is a 112pt **left** rail; Closed Duo is stock bottom tabs (no rail). Regular iPhone stays stock. Subs / first show is `popToRoot` onto RedditList. **Book split (follow-on):** `ApolloDuoBook` hosts feed \| comments on a wide Open window (even if the sim hinge reports Closed) and mid-open book — see `docs/duo-book-layout.md`. Do **not** wrap tabs in `UISplitViewController`. | Inbox is not a rail item. First-slice book split is main feed → post only. |
| Toolchain | **Step 5:** device `make package` pins `iphone:clang:27.1:14.0` when `iPhoneOS27.1.sdk` exists; otherwise `26.0:14.0`. Sim: unchanged `latest` / 15.0. **Screen-fill:** `--liquid-glass` now sets the *guest* `LC_BUILD_VERSION` sdk to **27.1** (still min 15.0) so Duo grants a full canvas; `IsLiquidGlass()` remains major >= 19. | A 27.1 Simulator runtime is not a device SDK. Cached `.sim/glass-base.ipa` at 19.0 must be regenerated. Classic (no glass) guests stay letterboxed. CI (Xcode 26.0.1) stays on the tweak 26.0 fallback. |

## Phased work

### 1. Device identity + live island geometry — this change

- Unrecognized `iPhone*` machine IDs remap to `iPhone15,2` unless they are a
  known notch exception (`src/ApolloDeviceIdentity.h`).
- Island rect / Pixel Pal shift / chrome visibility live in
  `src/ApolloDeviceGeometry.{h,m}` and key off the window's scene screen.
- Feed-search's last-resort `59.0` top inset is gone; it reads a live window
  safe area instead (`ApolloSearchInPlace.xm`).

Do **not** expand this step into ArrangementView, size-class feed rewrites, or
an SDK bump.

### 2. Floating tabs + Liquid Glass follow the active scene — done

- Overlay binds to the foreground `UIWindowScene` (`ApolloDeviceGeometry`).
  No scene yet → `CGRectZero` window, then `window.windowScene =` on
  `UISceneDidActivate`. `mainScreen.bounds` is not a geometry source.
- Root overlay VC relayouts on rotation, `safeAreaInsetsDidChange`,
  horizontal/vertical size-class changes, and bounds changes.
- Dock / tucked sliver / close target / preview / fan-out use
  `ApolloDeviceChromeInsetsForView` so horizontal safe areas and
  hinge-sized layout-margin extras apply. Standard 16pt system margins
  do **not** push bubbles inward on a normal iPhone
  (`src/ApolloDeviceChromeInsets.h`).
- Liquid Glass title fitting uses the same insets; search-cancel reservation
  no longer re-subtracts `layoutMargins.right` on top of that.

Do **not** expand this step into feed size-class layouts, ArrangementView,
or an SDK bump.

### 3. Feed / post size-class layouts — reset

- Inventory: stock Apollo has almost no `horizontalSizeClass` /
  `UISplitViewController` usage. `ApolloAutoHideMetaFeeds` still walks
  split columns defensively if one ever appears.
- **Runtime tiling is disabled.** Mail-style dual-VC hosting inside one
  `UINavigationController` (Apply / midX clamps / SetPrimaryAlongside /
  stack surgery) is off. Compact / cover / portrait are stock push/pop
  with no column pinning.
- Open vs Closed comes from the app `UIWindow` bounds (never
  `UIScreen.mainScreen`). Open is a wide landscape-sized window
  (112pt **left** rail). Closed is a portrait-sized Duo window,
  including cover/front (112pt **right** rail). Both Duo modes hide
  the bottom tab bar. Regular iPhone (not dual, not wide) keeps the
  stock tab bar. Fold/unfold re-fills the window and re-syncs the
  rail. Per-cell RedditList Tighten is a no-op.
  Subs / first show is stock `popToRoot` onto RedditList. Home /
  Popular / All are stock feed pushes. `UISplitViewController` /
  `UIArrangementViewController` are not adopted — wrapping a tab nav
  would break settings, floating tabs, swipe-up comments, and URL
  routing.
- The 112pt sidebar is flush to the leading edge on Open and the
  trailing edge on Closed. Top is `safe.top + 8` only. Content
  additional safe-area is 120pt on the rail side. A–Z stays stock
  until the overlay follow-up. Closed still lifts the comment-jump
  FAB with the 80×120 cover-pill extras so it clears Duo’s system
  gear *and* the Apollo rail. Do not write layoutMargins or
  re-toggle constraints from `layoutSubviews` (that hung the Duo
  sim). No midX Apply loops and no `UIView` `layoutSubviews`
  frame-lock.
- Do **not** turn on `ApolloIPadTabBarBottom` on iPhone idiom Regular.

Do **not** expand this step into ArrangementView / reservedRegions or an
SDK bump.

### 4. Gallery / media hinge avoidance — done

- Do **not** wrap media in `UIArrangementViewController`. Do **not** call
  UIKit `reservedRegions` / `reservedRegionsForKind:options:` — probing
  kinds 0..2 on a normal navigation view SIGSEGVs on the Duo sim even
  after `view.window` and `windowScene` are set (first CA commit,
  `x0=NULL` at +0x10). That is not an NSException.
- Soft-degrade: `ApolloReservedCollect` returns 0 / zero margins, so
  `ApolloDeviceMediaInsetsForView` equals `ApolloDeviceChromeInsetsForView`
  (safe area + hinge-sized layout-margin extra). iOS 14 builds unchanged.
- A center hinge is a **gap**, not left+right edge insets (those would
  collapse the whole viewer). Edge-flush camera / island occlusions max
  with chrome so an island already inside `safe.top` is not double-counted.
- Gallery viewer chrome, gallery footer, MediaPage close button, fullscreen
  PiP button, and the in-app PiP card use that path.
  `UIArrangementViewController` is logged if present and left unused —
  wrapping the pager would break presentation / swipe-up / PiP.
- MediaViewer is **stock full-screen**. Trailing-half pins are gone
  (they left ghosts after dismiss). `reservedRegions` stays unused.
- `_exclusionArea` is still island-only (pill sanity). A non-pill rect is
  not treated as a hinge.

### 5. Toolchain toward iOS 27.1 — done

- Device pin (Makefile, only when `TARGET` is not on the command line):
  `iphone:clang:27.1:14.0` if `iPhoneOS27.1.sdk` exists in `$THEOS/sdks`
  (`THEOS_SDKS_PATH`) or `$(xcode-select -p)/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs`;
  else `iphone:clang:26.0:14.0`. Floor stays `:14.0`. Override with
  `APOLLO_DEVICE_SDK=27.1` or `26.0`.
- Theos matches the **folder name** `iPhoneOS<version>.sdk` (see
  `$THEOS/makefiles/targets/_common/darwin_head.mk`). The unversioned
  `iPhoneOS.sdk` does not satisfy a `27.1` pin.
- **Do not** copy Xcode 26.6's `iPhoneOS.sdk` (or any 26.x device SDK) to
  `$THEOS/sdks/iPhoneOS27.1.sdk`. An iOS 27.1 Simulator runtime
  (`com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-27-1`) is not this SDK. Confirm
  `SDKSettings.json` → `Version` is `27.1` before copying from an Xcode
  that actually ships the 27.1 *device* SDK.
- Simulator stays on `latest` / `DEPLOY_MIN=15.0` (`scripts/run-in-sim.sh`).
  Do not pair an old Simulator SDK with a newer clang.
- CI workflows still `xcode-select` Xcode 26.0.1 and do not install 27.1.
  The Makefile fallback keeps those builds on 26.0. When a runner later
  ships a real `iPhoneOS27.1.sdk`, the pin flips without a workflow change.
- Do **not** call `reservedRegions` from the launch / first-layout path.
  A window+scene guard was not enough on Duo. Revisit only with a
  documented-safe UIKit API after compiling against a real
  `iPhoneOS27.1.sdk` — never reintroduce a delayed probe in a crash fix.

### 6. Fill the inner Duo display — this change

Root cause of the "phone column on the left of a large Duo frame":
iPhone Duo letterboxes the **guest Apollo binary** from its
`LC_BUILD_VERSION` SDK, not from the tweak's Theos pin.

| Guest SDK (vtool) | Duo inner canvas |
| --- | --- |
| stock Apollo (iOS 16) or glass `19.0` | Phone-sized column, black/chrome unused |
| iOS 27.0 | More room, still gaps |
| iOS 27.1 | Full-bleed to the screen edges |

`--liquid-glass` used `vtool -set-build-version ios 15.0 19.0`. That
flips `IsLiquidGlass()` (major >= 19) but Duo still treats the app as
pre-27. The bump is now `ios 15.0 27.1`. Classic / icons-only builds are
unchanged (no SDK bump → still letterboxed; use `--glass`).

Runtime belt (`src/ApolloDeviceDisplay.{h,m,xm}`):

- Prefer the largest foreground scene when two attached screens look like
  inner+cover (area ratio >= 1.25). Single-screen iPhone / iPad keep the
  first-active scene (no Stage Manager surprise).
- Raise `sizeRestrictions` and `requestGeometryUpdate` when those
  selectors exist; resize `ThemeableWindow` to the scene/screen canvas
  if it is still a phone column.
- Floating-tab overlay binds to **the app window's scene**, not a
  different preferred scene, so a full-size passthrough window cannot
  sit on the unused chrome and eat hits. `canBecomeKeyWindow` stays NO.
- Do **not** wrap the app in `UISplitViewController`. FeedSplit
  runtime tiling is **disabled**; open Duo is rail + stock nav.
- Open: 112pt rail on the **far left**. Closed (cover / portrait-sized
  Duo window): 112pt rail on the **far right**. Both hide the bottom
  tab bar. Items: Posts/Subs, Home, Popular, All, Profile, Settings.
  Launch selects Subs and `popToRoot`s onto RedditList. Regular
  iPhone keeps the stock tab bar.

Dual `simctl io` displays (LCD vs LCD-1) still need `--display` when
screenshotting.

Verify on a Mac:

```bash
# Cached .sim/glass-base.ipa at sdk 19.0 will be regenerated.
SIM_NAME="Apollo Duo" \
SIM_RUNTIME=com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-27-1 \
scripts/run-in-sim.sh --glass --fresh-app --logs
```

Expect `[DeviceDisplay] canvas fill hook installed`, `[DuoRail]
shown leading sidebar` / `trailing sidebar`, and `[FeedSplit]
tiling disabled`. The UI must span the **full** window (not a
phone column) with the rail on the **left** when Open and the
**right** when Closed. Launch is Subs / stock RedditList.
RedditList / feeds fill the width right of the rail.
Opening a post is a stock push. Compact / cover stay stock (no rail,
no column pin).
`vtool -show-build .sim/Payload/Apollo.app/Apollo` should report `sdk 27.1`.

## Testing

The cloud Linux VM cannot run Theos or the iOS Simulator. Validate on a Mac:

```bash
# Host-side identity + chrome-inset + feed-split + reserved-region + canvas math
tests/run_device_identity_tests.sh
tests/run_feed_split_layout_tests.sh
tests/run_duo_book_layout_tests.sh
tests/run_reserved_region_tests.sh
tests/run_device_display_tests.sh
tests/run_duo_rail_layout_tests.sh
tests/run_duo_compatibility_tests.sh

# Default inner loop
scripts/run-in-sim.sh --logs

# Known island / notch sims (names vary by Xcode)
SIM_DEVICE_TYPE=iPhone-16-Pro scripts/run-in-sim.sh --logs
SIM_DEVICE_TYPE=iPhone-16e scripts/run-in-sim.sh --logs   # notch exception
SIM_DEVICE_TYPE=iPhone-Air scripts/run-in-sim.sh --logs   # #826 geometry

# Optional: glass chrome + floating tabs
scripts/run-in-sim.sh --glass --logs
```

Confirm floating tabs / Liquid Glass (step 2):

- Enable Floating Tabs; keep a post; rotate and (if available) change
  simulated size. Bubbles stay on the scene edges, not `mainScreen`.
- Landscape: dock/tuck/✕ sit inside the horizontal safe area.
- Liquid Glass: long titles truncate before the leading/trailing chrome;
  search cancel still fits.
- `[FloatingTabs] Overlay window created (scene=yes)` / `Overlay rebound`
  in `apollofix` logs.

Confirm feed size-class layout (step 3 + open Duo):

- Regular iPhone portrait and Plus/Max landscape: stock tab bar;
  no rail; no column pin.
- Closed Duo (portrait-sized window, including cover): **right**
  112pt rail, tab bar hidden.
- Open Duo (wide landscape window): **left** 112pt rail, tab bar
  hidden. Launch selects Subs and shows stock RedditList. Fold /
  unfold must move the rail and refill the window. Do not write
  layoutMargins or re-toggle constraints from layoutSubviews.
- Overscrolling comments must not reveal a second copy of the post
  (tiling is off, so there is no leftover detail host).
- Swipe-up-for-comments media pane is unchanged (sheet).
- iPad "Move Tab Bar to Bottom" stays off on iPhone.

Confirm gallery / media hinge avoidance (step 4):

- Gallery Done / transport and PiP corners use chrome / safe-area /
  layoutMargins (reserved-rect list is always empty). Launch on Duo must
  not SIGSEGV in UIKit reservedRegions.
- PiP last-resort window is created from `ApolloDevicePreferredScreen()`,
  not a raw `mainScreen.bounds` read.
- When a Duo sim / 27.1 runtime exists: open Gallery and MediaViewer on
  the inner display, partially fold. Transport / close / PiP card stay
  off a hinge that UIKit reports as safe area or extra layout margin.
- MediaViewer is stock full-screen. Swipe-dismiss must not leave a
  ghost column or a pinned trailing frame.
- Gallery grid column-count stays on the chrome-only path (no division
  probe) until a safe reserved-region API exists.

Confirm Pixel Pals / faux cutout:

- 14 Pro baseline: no y-shift (island matches Apollo's 11.5).
- Newer island phones: pals sit on the live cutout, not a 59pt rule.
- 16e / 17e: no faux island.
- Display Zoom and landscape: island rect still tracks `_exclusionArea`.
- `subsystem == "apollofix"` logs `[PixelPals] island cutout …` once.

When a Duo simulator or device exists:

- Launch folded and unfolded; fold while a feed, comments, gallery, and a
  floating tab are open.
- Confirm the faux island is only on the panel that has a pill cutout.
- Fold with a floating tab open: overlay should follow the active scene;
  slivers should not rest in a hinge strip that UIKit reports as safe area
  or extra layout margin.
- Gallery / MediaViewer / PiP should already clear a reserved-region
  hinge. A fold UIKit does not report is still unfixable without guessing.
  Regular-width feed / comments stay stock push/pop (tiling is off).

Device IPA remains required for APNs, FFmpeg v.redd.it remux, and anything
the sim stubs.

## Residual risks

- Stock Apollo may still assume a single phone-sized window. Steps 1–4
  cannot invent a hinge UIKit does not expose as reservedRegions, safe
  area, or extra layout margin.
- Open Duo no longer pins two VCs in one nav. Floating tabs, URL
  routing, and swipe-up capture still see `ApolloNavigationController`
  because navigation is stock. Do not reintroduce Mail-style dual-VC
  hosting, `viewDidLayout` Apply / midX clamps, or SetPrimaryAlongside.
- Plus/Max landscape is Regular but below the rail's wide-single
  floor (~800pt) and is not dual-display, so those users keep the
  stock tab bar. The rail is Duo-inner / very-wide Regular only.
- Some Texture / post cells may still size from the screen width rather
  than the safe-area-inset bounds. Devvit already reacts to size-class
  changes. `additionalSafeAreaInsets.right` may be ignored by Texture
  on Posts — accepted for v1 vs pinning columns.
- `_exclusionArea` is private. If it disappears or starts returning hinge
  rects, the pill sanity check fails closed (no shift, hide tweak chrome).
- `uname` remapping is process-wide, happens on arbitrary threads, and does
  not consult UIKit. Later layout uses the live window's cutout.
- Do **not** call iOS 27.1 `reservedRegions` (any selector spelling) from
  this tweak. Window+scene is not a sufficient guard: first CA commit on
  Duo still SIGSEGVs (`x0=NULL` at +0x10). C geometry helpers stay; gutters
  come from layoutMargins / chrome. Do not add a delayed probe.
- A 27.1 device SDK may set `MinimumDeploymentTarget` to 15.0 the same
  way later 26/27 SDKs did. We still pass `:14.0`. If clang starts
  hard-failing that combination, keep the 26.0 fallback for ship builds
  rather than raising the floor.
- `UIArrangementViewController` is intentionally not adopted for
  MediaViewer / gallery (full-bleed pager, not a primary/secondary pair).
- Duo full-bleed is a **guest SDK** advertisement. Runtime window fill
  cannot enlarge a scene UIKit has already letterboxed if the system
  refuses `requestGeometryUpdate`. Classic / `--liquid-glass-icons`
  builds stay in the phone column until they are glass-patched.
- SDK 27.1 also opts the guest into Duo's vertical navigation / toolbar
  placement. Apollo's custom nav may look different from 19.0 glass;
  report leftovers rather than fighting UIKit's chrome.
- Cover / Closed Duo now **does** get Apollo's trailing rail (Aaron
  confirmed). Duo's system pill stays; the comment-jump FAB still
  uses the 80×120 extras so it clears both. Screenshot `simctl io`
  may pick LCD vs LCD-1 — pass the display id. Touches on unused
  chrome should fall through the floating-tab overlay (`hitTest` +
  same-scene bind).
- Apollo's Posts-tab second tap still pops to the list. That is stock
  navigation.
- The Duo rail hides the stock tab bar (and `_UITabContainerView` when
  present). Inbox is not a rail item; open it from the inbox destination
  Apollo already owns. Auto-hide-on-scroll will not unhide the tab bar
  while the rail is active.
- Sort pills (Hot/New/Top/Rising) stay Apollo's existing feed chrome —
  the rail does not reimplement them.
- Subs / first show is stock `popToRoot` onto RedditList. A sub tap is
  Apollo's own push. Home / Popular / All are stock feed opens. There
  is no list|feed or feed|comments tile, no PairOnStack, and no
  Mail-replace of a right pane. Do **not** add UIView `layoutSubviews`
  frame-lock hooks (they freeze scroll and buttons).
- The slim rail **hugs** the leading edge (4pt) on **landscape Regular
  only**. Portrait / Compact / `ShouldShow == NO` tear the rail down
  and zero every leftover leading inset (and preferredContentSize fill
  hacks). Top is `safe.top + 8` (ignore the trailing status pill).
  A–Z stays stock. Cover Compact never gets an Apollo rail;
  dual-display Compact insets FABs 80×120 off Duo’s system pill.
  Open-Duo RedditList / feeds / posts fill the width right of the rail
  (stock nav letterbox is expanded; no SetPrimaryAlongside). Tab
  children get `additionalSafeAreaInsets.left` = rail + 16pt (80) while
  the rail is shown so feed vote chrome and RedditList *rows* keep that
  inset while scrolling (do not cancel it after a one-shot frame shift).
  Texture `ASTableView` is frame-shifted after its own layout (it ignores
  safe area). Right stays 0. Subs must not call `goToHomeTab` —
  that pops/resets the stack.
